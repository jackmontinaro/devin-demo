This is a demo for the feature flag amdin dashboard.

It shows the capabilities of Devin, and how one can create a workflow trigger with the click of a button.

## Startup guide

1. Configure your secrets in a `.env` file
    - DEVIN_API_TOKEN
    - TARGET_REPO (should be something connected to Devin already)
2. To run locally: 
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    `python app.py`, then open http://localhost:5000
